# Payment APIs Demo Client & Server

Copyright Â© 2017 Bambora Inc.

This repo contains a simple merchant Python/Flask server and associated Web and iOS clients to help process payments.
The demo server & clients are intended to be simple examples that can help you with your production implementation.

# Server

Feel free to [view and try out](https://demo.na.bambora.com) the Payment APIs Demo web app now!

The server project requires Python 3. To build & run the server for local dev you can use a SQLite DB and
try the server out by just setting your Bambora Payments API Passcode as a server side environment variable
and then start up as follows.

## Server Setup & Installation

* Execute a git clone command on this repo and in a terminal cd into the root project directory.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bambora/na-payment-apis-demo.git
$ cd na-payment-apis-demo/server/app
```

* Install virtualenv (if not already available)
```bash
$ [sudo] pip install virtualenv
```

* Create (if not already created) and/or Activate project environment
```bash
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

* Install/update project dependencies
```bash
(venv) app$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution (Development Only)

### Set up Environment Variables
#### Mac/Linux
```bash
(venv) app$ export SERVER_URL_BASE="https://api.na.bambora.com"  # Defaults to this and can be omitted
(venv) app$ export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////tmp/mobilepay-demo.db  # Defaults to this and can be omitted
(venv) app$ export API_PASSCODE=<your_merchant_payments_passcode>
(venv) app$ export MERCHANT_ID=<your_bambora_merchant_id>
(venv) app$ export HASH_KEY=<your_hash_key>
```

#### Windows
```bash
(venv) app$ $env:SERVER_URL_BASE ="https://api.na.bambora.com"  # Defaults to this and can be omitted
(venv) app$ $env:DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:////users/<your_user>/appdata/local/temp/mobilepay-demo.db"
(venv) app$ $env:API_PASSCODE = "<your_merchant_payments_passcode>"
(venv) app$ $env:MERCHANT_ID = "<your_bambora_merchant_id>"
(venv) app$ $env:HASH_KEY = "<your_hash_key>"
```

### Run
```bash
(venv) app$ python server.py
```

# Mobile Payment Clients

Apple Pay or Android Pay payment requests are initiated from mobile clients and then, if successful, an Apple Pay or
Android Pay token is transmitted to the demo payment server, which records the payment request and executes the Bambora
Payments API.

In your production flow, a mobile client might transmit other info such as the customer identifier,
detailed sales/inventory data, and related shipping and billing addresses. This info might be recorded
on a merchant's CRM (as an example), and then a request to process the payment using the Apple Pay or
Android Pay token would then be made to the Bambora Payments API. Upon success or failure to process
the payment, the merchant's CRM could be updated and the originating mobile client would then receive a response.

# iOS Client

The iOS client project was built with XCode 8 and requires Swift 3.0.

## Apple Pay and the Bambora Payments API

When an Apple Pay client makes a payment request, it first gets an Apple Pay payment token using standard Apple SDK
APIs. It then communicates this info to the Demo Server which is responsible for interacting with the
Bambora Payments API. The Bambora Payments API has been updated to allow for Apple Pay transactions
and the following is a sample POST parameter to use with a RESTful invocation of the Payments API.

```
payload = {
    'amount': float(<purchase_amount>),
    'payment_method': 'apple_pay',
    'apple_pay': {
        'apple_pay_merchant_id': <your_apple_pay_merchant_id>,
        'payment_token': <apple_pay_base64_encoded_token>,
        'complete': <true (Defaults to true if omitted. Used for a purchase) | false (Used for a Pre-Auth.)>
    }
}
```

# Android Client

The Android client project was built with Android Studio v2.3.1.

## Android Pay and the Bambora Payments API

When an Android Pay client makes a payment request, it first gets an Android Pay payment token using standard Android
SDK APIs. It then communicates this info to the Demo Server which is responsible for interacting with the
Bambora Payments API. The Bambora Payments API has been updated to allow for Android Pay transactions
and the following is a sample POST parameter to use with a RESTful invocation of the Payments API.

```
payload = {
    'amount': float(<purchase_amount>),
    'payment_method': 'android_pay',
    'android_pay': {
        'apple_pay_merchant_id': <your_android_pay_merchant_id>,
        'payment_token': <apple_pay_base64_encoded_token>,
        'complete': <true (Defaults to true if omitted. Used for a purchase) | false (Used for a Pre-Auth.)>
    }
}
```
